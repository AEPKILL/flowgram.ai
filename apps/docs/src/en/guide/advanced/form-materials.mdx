# Official Form Materials  

## How to Use?  

### Via Package Reference  

Official form materials can be used directly via package reference:  

```tsx
import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm install @flowgram.ai/form-materials"
}} />
```

```tsx
import { JsonSchemaEditor } from '@flowgram.ai/form-materials'
```  

### Adding Material Source Code via CLI  

If customization is required (e.g., modifying text, styles, or business logic), it is recommended to **add the material source code to the project for customization via CLI**:  

```bash
npx @flowgram.ai/form-materials
```  

After running, the CLI will prompt the user to select the material to add:  

```console
? Select one material to add: (Use arrow keys)  
‚ùØ components/json-schema-editor  
  components/type-selector  
  components/variable-selector  
```  

Users can also directly add the source code of a specific material via CLI:  

```bash
npx @flowgram.ai/form-materials components/json-schema-editor  
```  

Once the CLI completes successfully, the relevant materials will be automatically added to the `src/form-materials` directory in the current project.  

:::warning Notes  

1. The official materials are currently implemented based on [Semi Design](https://semi.design/). If there are requirements for an underlying component library, the source code can be copied via CLI and replaced.  
2. Some materials depend on third-party npm libraries, which will be automatically installed during CLI execution.  
3. Some materials depend on other official materials. The source code of these dependent materials will also be added to the project during CLI execution.
