# Question & Answer
## Why not use ReactFlow
- ReactFlow doesn't handle data modeling or provide layout algorithms. It only handles rendering, which means development costs remain high for complex features.
See: https://reactflow.dev/examples/nodes/custom-node
- ReactFlow's interaction customization is costly. For example, it's difficult to select nodes when the canvas is zoomed out, and it doesn't support drag-and-drop reconnection of lines.

## Why IOC is Needed

:::tip Key Concepts:
- Inversion of Control (IOC): A design principle in object-oriented programming that reduces coupling between code modules. The most common implementation is Dependency Injection (DI)
- Domain Logic: Also known as Business Logic, these are logic components related to specific product features
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): The core design principle is to split software systems into common logic (cross-cutting, pervasive) and domain logic (vertical-cutting) aspects. Cross-cutting parts can be "consumed as needed" by all vertical-cutting parts

:::

Before answering this question, let's understand aspect-oriented programming. AOP aims to break down domain logic into finer granularity, where cross-cutting parts can be "consumed as needed" by vertical-cutting parts. The connection between cross-cutting and vertical-cutting is called Weaving, and IOC plays the role of Weaving injection into vertical-cutting parts.

Ideal Aspect-Oriented Programming

```ts
- myAppliation provides business logic
  - service specific business logic services
     - customDomainLogicService
  - contributionImplement hook registration instantiation
    - MyApplicationContributionImpl
  - component business components

- core provides common logic
  - model common models
  - contribution hook interfaces
     - LifecycleContribution application lifecycle
     - CommandContribution
  - service common services
     - CommandService
     - ClipboardService
  - component common components
  ```

  ```ts
  // IOC injection
@injectable()
export class CustomDomainLogicService {
  @inject(FlowContextService) protected flowContextService: FlowContextService;
  @inject(CommandService) protected commandService: CommandService;
  @inject(SelectionService) protected selectionService: SelectionService;
}
// IOC interface declaration
interface LifecycleContribution {
   onInit(): void
   onStart(): void
   onDispose(): void
}
// IOC interface implementation
@injectable()
export class MyApplicationContributionImpl implement LifecycleContribution {
    onStart(): void {
      // Specific business logic code
    }
}

// Manually mount to lifecycle hook
bind(LifecycleContribution).toService(MyApplicationContributionImpl)
```

:::warning IOC is a means of aspect-oriented programming. After introduction, underlying modules can expose interfaces for external registration, bringing benefits:
- Implements microkernel + plugin design, enabling plugin modularity and on-demand consumption
- Allows cleaner package separation, implementing feature-based package splitting

## Why ECS is Needed

:::warning ECS (Entity-Component-System)
Suitable for decoupling large data objects, commonly used in games where each character (Entity) has extensive data that needs to be split into physics engine-related data, skin-related, character attributes, etc. (multiple Components) for consumption by different subsystems (Systems). Flow data structures are complex and well-suited for ECS decomposition.

ReduxStore Pseudo Code
```jsx pure
const store = () => ({
  nodes: [{
    position: any
    form: any
    data3: any

  }],
  edges: []
})

function Playground() {
  const { nodes } = useStore(store)

  return nodes.map(node => <Node data={node} />)
}
```
Advantages:
- Simple to use with centralized data management

Disadvantages:
- Centralized data management cannot update precisely, leading to performance bottlenecks
- Poor extensibility, adding new node data couples everything into one large JSON

ECS Solution
Note:
- NodeData corresponds to ECS - Component
- Layer corresponds to ECS - System
```jsx pure
class FlowDocument {
dataDefines: [
  NodePositionData,
  NodeFormData,
  NodeLineData
]
nodeEntities: Entity[] = []
}


class Entity {
id: string // Only ID without data
getData: (dataId: string) => EntityData
}

// Render lines
class LinesLayer {
@observeEntityData(NodeLineData) lines
render() {
  return lines.map(line => <Line data={line} />)
}
}

// Render node positions
class NodePositionsLayer {
@observeEntityData(NodePositionData) positions
return() {

}
}

// Render node forms
class  NodeFormsLayer {
  @observeEntityData(NodeFormData) contents
return() {}
}

class Playground {
layers: [
  LinesLayer, // Line rendering
  NodePositionsLayer, // Position rendering
  NodeFormsLayer // Content rendering
]
render() {
  return this.layers.map(layer => layer.render())
}
}
```
Advantages:
- Node data is separated for individual rendering control, enabling precise performance updates
- Strong extensibility, adding new node data only requires adding XXXData + XXXLayer

Disadvantages:
- Has a learning curve
