# Variable Engine

## Overall Design

### Architecture Layers

:::warning Architecture Layers
The variable engine design follows the DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) principle, divided into three layers based on code stability, abstraction level, and proximity to business:
- Variable Abstract Layer: The highest level of abstraction and most stable part in the variable architecture
- Variable Implementation Layer: The more volatile part of the variable architecture, typically requiring adjustments between different business needs
- Variable Business Layer: The Facade provided to business in the variable architecture, interacting with canvas engine and node engine

### Terminology

#### üåü Scope
:::warning ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Definition:
A conventional space where variable declarations and consumption are described through AST
- Conventional space: The space is entirely defined by business needs
  - In low-code design mode, it can be a node, a component, a right panel...
  - In code, it can be a Statement, a code block, a function, a file...

:::

What constitutes a scope's space? This can be defined by different business needs.


#### üåü Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

:::warning Definition:
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è A protocol that combines AST nodes in a tree structure to implement explicit/implicit CRUD operations on variable information
- AST Node: Reactive protocol nodes in the AST
- Explicit CRUD, e.g.: Business explicitly sets a variable's type
- Implicit CRUD, e.g.: Business declares a variable, and its type is automatically inferred from initialization parameters

:::

:::warning Variable information in scopes - variables, types, expressions, structures, etc. - are essentially combinations of AST nodes
- Variable -> VariableDeclaration node
- Expression -> Expression node
- Type -> TypeNode node
- Structure -> StructDeclaration node

#### Variable

:::warning Definition:
An AST node used to declare new variables, using a unique identifier to point to a value that changes within a specific set range
- Value changing within a specific set range: The variable's value must be within the range described by its variable type
- Unique identifier: Variables must have a unique Key value

#### Variable Type

:::warning Definition:
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è An AST node used to constrain a variable, where the constrained variable's value can only change within a predetermined set range
- A variable can be bound to a variable type

### Visual Understanding of Variable Engine

:::warning Imagine a variable engine world where:
- Each scope defines a "country"
- Each country contains three main citizens: declarations, types, and expressions
- Countries communicate with each other through scope chains
